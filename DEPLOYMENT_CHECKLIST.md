## Quick Test Script

Run this after deployment to verify everything works:

1. **Professor Flow** (5 minutes)
   - Login at `/professor/login`
   - Start session
   - Verify QR code displays
   - Check QR code rotates every 5s

2. **Student Flow** (5 minutes)
   - Open homepage on mobile
   - Enter test data
   - Grant permissions
   - Scan QR code
   - Verify success message

3. **Validation Tests** (10 minutes)
   - Try scanning from >50m away (should fail)
   - Try scanning twice with same device (should fail)
   - Wait >10s and scan old QR (should fail)
   - Verify all failures logged in invalid_scans

4. **Manual Override** (2 minutes)
   - Open session page
   - Click "Manual Override"
   - Add student manually
   - Verify appears in valid scans

5. **Session End** (2 minutes)
