# Fix: Allow Multiple Students to Scan Same QR Code

## Problem
When multiple students tried to scan the same QR code at the same time, only the first student succeeded. All other students received an error: **"This QR code has already been used"**.

## Root Cause
The system had an unnecessary **Validation 7** that checked if a server nonce had been used by ANY student. This validation was redundant and incorrectly prevented multiple students from scanning the same QR code.

## Solution
**Removed the server nonce validation entirely** because it's redundant:

1. **Validation 4** already prevents the same device from scanning twice per session
2. **Validation 6** ensures QR tokens expire after 10 seconds
3. Multiple students **SHOULD** be able to scan the same QR code - that's the point!

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **[src/app/api/scans/submit/route.ts](src/app/api/scans/submit/route.ts)**
   - Removed Validation 7 (server nonce check) at lines 189-219
   - Removed server nonce insertion after valid scan at lines 310-317

2. **No database changes required!**

## Deployment

Simply rebuild and restart the application:

```bash
# If using Docker:
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# If using development:
npm run dev
```

## Testing

After deployment, verify that:
1. ✅ Multiple students can scan the same QR code simultaneously
2. ✅ Same device still cannot scan twice (Validation 4 still works)
3. ✅ Expired QR codes are still rejected (Validation 6 still works)
4. ✅ GPS and timestamp validations still work

## Security Maintained

All existing security validations remain active:

| Validation | What it Checks | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1. Required fields | All necessary data present | ✅ Active |
| 2. GPS format | Valid coordinates | ✅ Active |
| 3. Session active | Session exists and running | ✅ Active |
| 4. Device duplicate | Same device can't scan twice | ✅ Active |
| 5. Token format | Valid QR token structure | ✅ Active |
| 6. Token expiration | QR code not expired (10s) | ✅ Active |
| ~~7. Nonce reuse~~ | ~~Prevent nonce reuse~~ | ❌ Removed (redundant) |
| 8. Timestamp | Clock synchronization | ✅ Active |
| 9. GPS distance | Student near professor | ✅ Active |

**The fix maintains all security while allowing the correct behavior: multiple students scanning the same QR code.**
