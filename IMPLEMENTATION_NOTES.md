# Professor Dashboard Implementation - Notes

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive session management features to the professor dashboard, including:
- Listing all sessions (active and past)
- Ending active sessions from the dashboard
- Exporting attendance data as CSV or Excel
- Archiving scans when sessions end
- Viewing past session details

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: Before using these features, you must run the SQL migration to create the `archived_scans` table.

The migration file is located at: `supabase_migration_archived_scans.sql`

### To apply the migration:

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_migration_archived_scans.sql`
   - Run the query

2. **Via Supabase CLI**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

## New Features

### 1. Professor Dashboard (`/professor/dashboard`)
- **Active Sessions Section**: Shows all currently active sessions with:
  - Real-time scan counts (valid/invalid)
  - Quick access to view or end sessions

- **Past Sessions Table**: Displays historical sessions with:
  - Date and duration
  - Total attendance counts
  - Link to view detailed records

### 2. Active Session Page (`/professor/session/[sessionId]`)
- **Export Buttons**: Before ending a session, professors can:
  - Export attendance as CSV
  - Export attendance as Excel (with session info sheet)

- Export buttons are disabled when there are no scans

### 3. Past Session Viewer (`/professor/session/[sessionId]/view`)
- View complete attendance records from ended sessions
- Export historical data as CSV or Excel
- Session summary with statistics
- Full list of all attendees with timestamps

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints:
1. `GET /api/sessions/list` - Fetch all sessions for a professor
2. `GET /api/sessions/[sessionId]/export?format=csv|excel` - Export session scans
3. `GET /api/sessions/[sessionId]/archived-scans` - Fetch archived scans for a past session

### Modified Endpoints:
1. `POST /api/sessions/end` - Now archives scans before ending session

## Data Flow

When a professor ends a session:
1. All valid scans are fetched from `scans_valid` table
2. Scans are copied to `archived_scans` table with timestamp
3. Session is marked as inactive (`is_active = false`)
4. QR tokens are deleted
5. Session end timestamp is recorded

## Export Format

### CSV Export
- Contains attendance data only
- Columns: #, Student Index, Name, Surname, Scanned At, Client Time, Distance (m), Device ID, App Version

### Excel Export
- **Sheet 1 (Attendance)**: All attendance records with formatting
- **Sheet 2 (Session Info)**: Session metadata including:
  - Session ID
  - Professor name
  - Start/end times
  - Total scans
  - Professor location

## Dependencies Added
- `xlsx` - For Excel file generation
- `json2csv` - For CSV export functionality

## Security Notes
- All endpoints require professor authentication via Bearer token
- Professors can only access their own sessions
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect archived scans
- Export functionality validates session ownership

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add filters to past sessions (by date range, attendance count)
- Add search functionality in archived scans
- Export invalid scans for analysis
- Bulk export for multiple sessions
- Statistics dashboard with charts
